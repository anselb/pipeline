# Pipeline

Pipeline is an app that keeps track of your job application pipeline.

Right now Pipeline only keeps track of your jobs and your status with those jobs. In the future, I would like to add:
- Organization for groups of people
- A dashboard for an advisor that allows them to see all of the students' progress in the pipeline
- API calls to LinkedIn to see if the advisor(s) have any connections that they could give to the students

## Built with:
- Node.js
- React with the Apollo Client
- GraphQL
- PostgreSQL
